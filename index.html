		The Warring Varini is a game based on the Germanic tribe Varini / Warini. You will be able to control them and lead them with tribal methods they would have used during their time.<br><br>

		You have a few abilities to help you manage your tribe.<br>

			Some "hidden" gameplay mechanics

		<p>
		I wanted the game to be a simulation of sorts, this includes a range of features from Children to combat levels based on strength that is different for each person. <br><br>

		Celebrations for example need to take place at least once every 10 turns, or else your people will not want to take part in activites and will start disobeying you. <br><br>

		Every single tribe has the same simulation going on with their selected population, and when you get someone from another tribe; all their stats and information with them is carried over into your tribe. <br><br>

		Certain tribes negotiations might seem quite random at first, but it is based on the differece of power level and history. If that particular group never got along with the Varini they will not negotiate. Otherwise its simply based on the difference of powerlevel.<br><br>

		The first woman, Embla will join your tribe at some point in your playthrough. She is considered a "blessing" and she will only come once. Her and Askr are the only two unique characters in the game. They serve as the starting point for the Varini in this new land. <br><br>
